transaction = interface.start(user_key, hits = 1)
# Should be check for
# provider_verification_key ==  transaction['provider_verification_key']:

# If the transaction was successful, you can go ahead with your service,
# After your services is done, you must either confirm it or cancel it

result = interface.confirm(transaction['id'])
# Result can be either true or exception

transaction = interface.start(user_key, hits = 2)
